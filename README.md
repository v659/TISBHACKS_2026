# TISBHACKS_2026
This is my TISBHACKS project!!!

When it is done, it is basically going to be like a NotebookLM, but better in a way(forget scalability)

The user can upload notes(Read through llm because some handwriting is so bad even ocr fails) they can be used as a reference for the level of the person who is studying. i am collecting
a list of trusted sites and resources that the AI refers to for explination and i have a whole prompt for how it will teach the concept. the hard part of the project(for me) will be the css....
